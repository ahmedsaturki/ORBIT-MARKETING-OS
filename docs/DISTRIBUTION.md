# ORBIT Distribution

Updated: 2026-09-28.

## Desktop

`release-desktop.yml` builds Windows, Linux, and macOS bundles when a `v*` tag is pushed, but first verifies that the tagged commit belongs to the `main` release lineage.

The current pipeline deliberately produces **unsigned** desktop artifacts. It also verifies the generated checksum manifest before publication. It generates `SHA256SUMS.txt` so users can verify downloaded files.

Signing is a separate release gate and must never use private signing keys committed to the repository.

## Mobile

The Expo project supports local development and web export. The current GitHub Actions mobile workflow produces an **unsigned Android debug validation artifact**, not a store release. Native Android/iOS distribution remains a separate gate because production signing, store accounts, and native build environments are product-release concerns.

## Web

The public web surface is live on the connected Vercel production project and responds correctly on the verified production routes.

The latest verified production deployment is Git-sourced, uses the Next.js framework, targets production, exposes the canonical `orbit-marketing-os.vercel.app` alias, and reports the exact current `main` SHA through the governed provenance endpoints.

The current release cycle has passed the Vercel Production Provenance and Web Deploy checks. The remaining Vercel action is the rollback drill to the previous verified candidate and back.

## Release integrity

Every distributed artifact must have a release tag, a checksum entry, and documented provenance. A green build job is evidence for the artifact build only; it is not evidence of code signing, store approval, current-main provenance, or platform-policy compliance.
